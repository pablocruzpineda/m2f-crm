## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/entities/deal/api/dealApi.ts` - Added activity logging to 5 functions

### Functions Enhanced
1. `createDeal()` - Logs deal creation
2. `updateDeal()` - Logs updates and status changes
3. `updateDealStage()` - Logs pipeline stage changes
4. `deleteDeal()` - Logs deal deletion
5. `assignDeal()` - Logs deal assignments

### Activity Types Used
- `created` - Deal created
- `updated` - Deal information updated
- `status_changed` - Deal status or stage changed
- `deleted` - Deal removed
- `assigned` - Deal assigned to team member

### Dual Logging System
Deals use a **dual logging system**:

1. **Internal `deal_activities` table**: 
   - Stores detailed deal history
   - Visible on individual deal pages
   - Includes notes, contact additions, etc.

2. **Main `activity_log` table**:
   - Feeds the workspace-wide activity feed
   - Shows important actions across all entities
   - Real-time subscriptions enabled

Both logs work together to provide comprehensive tracking.

## Activity Feed Views

### All Activities
Navigate to `/activity` to see all workspace activities including:
- Contact activities (create, update, delete, assign)
- **Deal activities** (create, update, stage change, delete, assign) âœ… NEW
- Team activities (member added/removed, role changes)

### Filtering
Use the activity filters to focus on specific activities:
- **Search**: Find deals by name
- **User Filter**: See activities by specific team members
- **Entity Type**: Filter by "deal" to see only deal activities
- **Action Filter**: Filter by action (created, updated, etc.)

---

## Status Summary

### âœ… Fully Implemented
- Contact activities (Phase 5.3 Step 8)
- Team member activities (Phase 5.3 Step 6)
- **Deal activities** (Just Added!) âœ…

### ðŸš§ To Be Implemented (Future)
- Settings activities (WhatsApp, theme changes)
- Message activities (sent, received)

## Performance Notes

- Activity logging is **non-blocking**: If logging fails, the main operation succeeds
- Logging happens **asynchronously** after the main database operation
- Real-time updates use **Supabase WebSocket subscriptions** for instant delivery
- Activities are **paginated** (50 per page) for optimal performance
