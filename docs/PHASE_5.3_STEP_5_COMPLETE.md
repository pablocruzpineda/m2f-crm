## Technical Implementation

### Filter Integration

**ContactsPage State:**
```typescript
const [assignmentTab, setAssignmentTab] = useState<'my' | 'all'>('my');
const [filters, setFilters] = useState<ContactFilters>({
  // ... other filters
  assigned_to: session?.user?.id, // Start with My Contacts
});

const handleAssignmentTabChange = (tab: 'my' | 'all') => {
  setAssignmentTab(tab);
  setFilters((prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    assigned_to: tab === 'my' ? session?.user?.id : undefined,
    page: 1, // Reset to first page
  }));
};
```

### API Filter Logic

**Contact API:**
```typescript
// Apply assignment filter (Phase 5.3)
if (filters?.assigned_to) {
  query = query.eq('assigned_to', filters.assigned_to);
}
```

**Deal API:**
```typescript
// Phase 5.3 - Assignment filter
if (assigned_to) {
  query = query.eq('assigned_to', assigned_to);
}
```

### RLS Policy Compatibility

The assignment filters work seamlessly with RLS policies:
- Members: RLS automatically restricts to assigned data
- Owners/Admins: RLS allows all data, filter adds user preference
- No conflicts or duplicate filtering

## UI/UX Patterns

### Consistent Design
- All assignment components use same team member display format
- Role badges consistently styled and positioned
- Loading states on all async operations
- Disabled states during mutations

### Visual Hierarchy
- Assignment section visually separate in forms
- Tabs clearly indicate active state
- Bulk dialog uses primary action color
- Indicators blend naturally with content

### Accessibility
- Proper label associations
- Keyboard navigation support
- Loading spinners for screen readers
- Focus management in dialogs

## Integration Points

### With Team Management (Step 4)
- Uses `useTeamMembers` hook
- Respects role permissions
- Shows team member changes immediately

### With Assignment APIs (Step 3)
- Forms use `createContact/Deal` with assigned_to
- Bulk operations use `bulkAssignContacts/Deals`
- Single reassignment uses `assignContact/Deal`

### With Permission System (Step 2)
- Uses `useUserRole` hook
- Checks `canAssignToOthers` permission
- Checks `canSeeAllData` for tab visibility
