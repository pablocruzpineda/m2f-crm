# Phase 5.3 - Step 7: Theme Permission Check - COMPLETE ✅

**Completion Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  

## Overview

Added permission checks to the Appearance Settings page to restrict theme customization to workspace owners only.

## Implementation Summary

### Problem

Previously, any team member could access and modify the workspace theme and logo, which could lead to unwanted changes by non-owners. The workspace appearance should be controlled by the owner to maintain brand consistency.

### Solution

Added role-based permission check using `useUserRole().canChangeTheme` permission at the top of the AppearanceSettingsPage component. Non-owners now see a clear access restriction message instead of the theme customization controls.

## Changes Made

### File Modified

**`src/pages/settings/ui/AppearanceSettingsPage.tsx`**

#### 1. Added Imports
```typescript
import { AlertTriangle } from 'lucide-react';
import { useUserRole } from '@/entities/workspace';
```

#### 2. Added Permission Check Hook
```typescript
export function AppearanceSettingsPage() {
  const { currentWorkspace } = useCurrentWorkspace();
  const { canChangeTheme } = useUserRole();  // NEW
  
  // ... rest of component
}
```

#### 3. Added Permission Guard
```typescript
// Phase 5.3 - Only workspace owner can change theme
if (!canChangeTheme) {
  return (
    <PageContainer>
      <PageHeader
        title="Appearance"
        description="Customize your workspace logo and theme"
      />
      <Card className="border-destructive">
        <CardHeader>
          <div className="flex items-start gap-3">
            <div className="rounded-full bg-destructive/15 p-2">
              <AlertTriangle className="h-5 w-5 text-destructive" />
            </div>
            <div>
              <CardTitle className="text-destructive">Access Restricted</CardTitle>
              <CardDescription className="mt-2">
                Only the workspace owner can change theme and appearance settings.
                Please contact your workspace owner if you need to make changes.
              </CardDescription>
            </div>
          </div>
        </CardHeader>
      </Card>
    </PageContainer>
  );
}
```

## Permission Matrix

| Role | Can Access Page | Can View Theme | Can Modify Theme |
|------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Owner** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Admin** | ✅ | ❌ (sees restriction) | ❌ |
| **Member** | ✅ | ❌ (sees restriction) | ❌ |
| **Viewer** | ✅ | ❌ (sees restriction) | ❌ |

## User Experience

### Owner View (Unchanged)
- Full access to theme customization
- Can upload/remove logo
- Can change colors (primary, secondary, accent)
- Can toggle light/dark mode
- Can reset to default theme

### Non-Owner View (New)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Appearance                              │
│  Customize your workspace logo and theme │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⚠️  Access Restricted                   │
│                                          │
│  Only the workspace owner can change     │
│  theme and appearance settings.          │
│  Please contact your workspace owner if  │
│  you need to make changes.               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## UI Design

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Red border around the card (`border-destructive`)
- Warning icon in circular background
- Clear "Access Restricted" title in red
- Helpful message explaining the restriction
- Professional and non-blocking design

**Accessibility:**
- Screen reader friendly message
- Clear visual indicators (icon + color)
- Consistent with other permission messages in the app

## Integration with Existing Permissions

This change uses the existing `canChangeTheme` permission from the `useUserRole` hook:

```typescript
// From src/entities/workspace/model/useUserRole.ts
export function useUserRole() {
  const { currentWorkspace } = useCurrentWorkspace();
  const { session } = useSession();
  
  // ... other code
  
  const canChangeTheme = isOwner;  // Only owner can change theme
  
  return {
    // ... other permissions
    canChangeTheme,
  };
}
```
