# Step 1 Complete: Database Migration Applied ✅

## What Was Created

### 1. Database Table: `team_invitations`

**Columns:**
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `workspace_id` - References workspaces
- `email` - Invitee email
- `full_name` - Invitee full name
- `phone` - Phone with country code
- `role` - Member role (owner/admin/member/viewer)
- `invited_by` - Who sent the invitation
- `invited_at` - Timestamp when invited
- `expires_at` - Expiration (default: 7 days from invited_at)
- `status` - pending/accepted/expired/cancelled
- `accepted_at` - When invitation was accepted (nullable)
- `token` - Unique secure token for magic link
- `user_id` - Set when invitation is accepted (nullable)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` - Standard timestamps

**Constraints:**
- Status must be one of: pending, accepted, expired, cancelled
- Token must be unique
- Only one pending invitation per email per workspace

### 2. Database Indexes
Created 5 indexes for optimal query performance:
- `idx_team_invitations_workspace_id` - For workspace queries
- `idx_team_invitations_email` - For email lookups
- `idx_team_invitations_token` - For token validation (fast!)
- `idx_team_invitations_status` - For filtering by status
- `idx_team_invitations_expires_at` - For expiry checks

### 3. RLS Policies
Three security policies created:
1. **Workspace members can view invitations** - Team members see their workspace invitations
2. **Workspace admins can manage invitations** - Owners/admins can create/update/delete
3. **Public can read by token** - Allows invitation acceptance page to work

### 4. Helper Function
`expire_old_invitations()` - Utility function to mark expired invitations
- Can be called manually or via cron job
- Updates all pending invitations past their expiry date

## Verification Steps

You can verify the migration was successful by running the SQL in:
`supabase/verify-team-invitations.sql`

This will show:
- ✅ Table exists
- ✅ All columns created correctly
- ✅ Indexes in place
- ✅ RLS policies active
- ✅ Helper function created

## What This Enables

With this database structure, we can now:
1. ✅ Create invitation records
2. ✅ Track invitation status
3. ✅ Validate magic link tokens
4. ✅ Expire old invitations
5. ✅ Manage invitation lifecycle
6. ✅ Secure access with RLS

## Next: Step 2 - Create Acceptance Page

Now that the database is ready, we'll create the invitation acceptance page where new users:
1. Click the magic link from WhatsApp
2. Land on `/accept-invitation/:token`
3. See a welcome message
4. Set their password
5. Get auto-logged in
6. Redirected to workspace
