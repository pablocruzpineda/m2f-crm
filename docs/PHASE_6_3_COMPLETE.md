## User Experience Flow

   - Click "Calendar" in sidebar
   - Opens to current month by default

2. **View Meetings**
   - See all meetings as colored blocks
   - Hover for quick details
   - Click for full details (TODO)

3. **Navigate Dates**
   - Use prev/next buttons
   - Click "Today" to return to current date
   - Calendar updates and refetches meetings

4. **Switch Views**
   - Click Month/Week/Day tabs
   - View persists during navigation

5. **Create Meeting**
   - Click empty time slot (TODO: Opens dialog)
   - Pre-fills selected date/time

## Styling Highlights

- Matches existing design system
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Accessibility-friendly contrast

## Next Steps (Phase 6.4)

Now that the calendar view is complete, the next phase is to build the meeting management UI:

### TODO: Meeting Creation Dialog
- MeetingForm component
- Date/time picker
- Duration selector
- Participant selector (users + contacts)
- Location and meeting URL fields
- Contact/Deal linking
- Form validation

### TODO: Meeting Detail View
- MeetingDetailPage or Dialog
- Display meeting information
- Show participants with RSVP status
- Display notes section
- Edit/Delete actions
- Join meeting button (if URL exists)

### TODO: Integration Points
- Connect slot selection to create dialog
- Connect event click to detail view
- Add meeting count badge to sidebar
- Show upcoming meetings on dashboard

## Technical Notes

### Type Safety
- All components fully typed
- CalendarEvent interface for event data
- Type-safe view switching
- Proper EventProps typing

### Performance
- Only fetches meetings for visible date range
- Memoizable event transformation
- Efficient re-renders
- Loading states prevent layout shift

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation supported by react-big-calendar
- ARIA labels on buttons
- Semantic HTML structure
- Focus management

## Testing Recommendations

1. **View Switching**
   - Test all three views render correctly
   - Verify events appear in all views

2. **Navigation**
   - Test date navigation
   - Verify meetings load for new date ranges
   - Test "Today" button

3. **Interactions**
   - Test slot selection
   - Test event clicking
   - Test hover states

4. **Responsive**
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Verify touch interactions
   - Check text truncation

5. **Edge Cases**
   - No meetings (empty state)
   - Many meetings on one day (show more)
   - All-day events
   - Multi-day events

## Success Metrics

✅ Calendar renders without errors  
✅ All three views functional  
✅ Meetings display correctly  
✅ Navigation works  
✅ Styling matches design system
