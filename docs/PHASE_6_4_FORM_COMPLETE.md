### 4. Feature Module

## Technical Details

### Form Schema
```typescript
{
  title: string (required)
  description?: string
  start_time: Date (required)
  time: string (required) - HH:mm format
  duration_minutes: string (required)
  timezone?: string
  location?: string
  meeting_url?: string (must be valid URL)
  participant_user_ids: string[]
  participant_contact_ids: string[]
}
```

### Form Submission Flow
1. User clicks calendar slot → Dialog opens with pre-filled date
2. User fills form fields
3. Form validates all fields
4. On submit:
   - Combines date + time into ISO string
   - Calculates end_time from duration
   - Adds workspace_id automatically
   - Calls createMeeting mutation
5. On success:
   - Dialog closes
   - Calendar refetches meetings (via React Query)
   - New meeting appears on calendar

### Hook Integrations
- ✅ `useTeamMembers` from `@/entities/team` - Fetches workspace members
- ✅ `useContacts` from `@/entities/contact` - Fetches workspace contacts
- ✅ `useCreateMeeting` from `@/entities/meeting` - Creates new meeting
- ✅ `useCurrentWorkspace` from `@/entities/workspace` - Gets active workspace

## Fixed Issues

### TypeScript Errors Fixed
1. ✅ Missing Command component - Created from scratch
2. ✅ Hook import paths - Changed from workspace to team entity
3. ✅ useContacts signature - Fixed to accept workspace_id string
4. ✅ Data access patterns - Changed from .contacts to .data
5. ✅ TeamMember properties - Changed user_id to id, profile.x to x
6. ✅ Form field naming - Aligned schema with form fields (time, duration_minutes)
7. ✅ Zod schema - Fixed date validation syntax
8. ✅ Type annotations - Added explicit types for callbacks
9. ✅ Non-null assertions - Added for hours/minutes split

### Dependency Conflicts Resolved
1. ✅ cmdk library installed successfully
2. ✅ Module resolution for Command component
3. ✅ TypeScript cache cleared
