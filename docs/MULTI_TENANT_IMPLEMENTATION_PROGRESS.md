# Multi-Tenant Sub-Account Implementation - Progress

**Date Started**: October 7, 2025  
**Status**: 🚧 In P#### **3. Workspace Selector Enhancement**
- ✅ Filter workspaces based on ownership and hierarchy
- ✅ Master owners see master + all sub-accounts
- ✅ Sub-account admins see only their sub-accounts
- ✅ Prevents sub-account admins from accessing master workspace
- [ ] Show visual hierarchy (indent sub-accounts) (FUTURE)
- [ ] Add badges (Master, Client) (FUTURE)
- [ ] Tree view with parent-child relationship (FUTURE)ss  
**Phase**: 2 of 6 Complete

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Database Foundation (COMPLETE)

### **Migration 050: Sub-Account Hierarchy**
Created `050_add_sub_account_hierarchy.sql` with:

#### **Schema Changes:**
- ✅ Added `parent_workspace_id UUID` column to `workspaces` table
- ✅ Added foreign key: `parent_workspace_id → workspaces(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
- ✅ Added constraint: `chk_no_self_parent` (prevents circular reference)
- ✅ Created index: `idx_workspaces_parent`
- ✅ Created index: `idx_workspaces_parent_id`

#### **Database Functions Created:**
1. ✅ `create_sub_account_workspace()` - Creates sub-account with proper membership
2. ✅ `get_sub_accounts()` - Returns all sub-accounts for master workspace
3. ✅ `get_master_workspace_for_user()` - Finds master workspace for user
4. ✅ `is_sub_account_workspace()` - Checks if workspace is sub-account

#### **Migration Applied:**
✅ Successfully applied to database with `npx supabase db push`

---

## ✅ Phase 2: API & Hooks (COMPLETE)

### **Entity Layer Created:**
`src/entities/sub-account/`

#### **API Functions** (`api/subAccountApi.ts`):
- ✅ `getSubAccounts(masterWorkspaceId)` - Fetch sub-accounts
- ✅ `createSubAccount(input)` - Create new sub-account
- ✅ `deleteSubAccount(subAccountId)` - Delete sub-account
- ✅ `getMasterWorkspace()` - Get master workspace for user
- ✅ `isSubAccountWorkspace(workspaceId)` - Check sub-account status
- ✅ `getWorkspaceHierarchy(workspaceId)` - Get parent/children structure

#### **React Query Hooks Created:**
1. ✅ `useSubAccounts(masterWorkspaceId)` - Fetch sub-accounts list
2. ✅ `useCreateSubAccount()` - Create sub-account mutation
3. ✅ `useDeleteSubAccount(masterWorkspaceId)` - Delete sub-account mutation
4. ✅ `useMasterWorkspace()` - Get master workspace for current user
5. ✅ `useIsSubAccount(workspaceId)` - Check if workspace is sub-account

#### **TypeScript Types Updated:**
- ✅ Added `parent_workspace_id` to `workspaces` table type
- ✅ Added relationship for `parent_workspace_id` foreign key
- ✅ Added 5 new RPC function types
- ✅ Created `SubAccount` interface
- ✅ Created `SubAccountWithDetails` interface
- ✅ Created `CreateSubAccountInput` interface

## 📋 Phase 3: Permissions (NEXT)

### **Goal:** Enable admins to change appearance for their sub-account

**Current Status:**
```typescript
export function canChangeTheme(role: Role): boolean {
    return role === 'owner'  // Already works!
}
```

**Why It Works:**
- Admins are **owners** of their sub-account workspace
- Existing permission already allows this ✅
- No code changes needed

**Verification Needed:**
- [ ] Test that sub-account admin can access appearance settings
- [ ] Test that theme changes only affect their sub-account
- [ ] Test that master owner can change master workspace theme

---

## ✅ Phase 4: UI Updates (COMPLETE)

### **Components Created:**

#### **1. Sub-Accounts Page** (`src/pages/sub-accounts/`)
- ✅ List all sub-accounts (master owner view)
- ✅ Show admin name, member count, created date
- ✅ "Create Sub-Account" button
- ✅ Delete actions per sub-account with confirmation
- ✅ Access restrictions for non-owners
- ✅ Empty state with helpful messaging
- ✅ Loading states

#### **2. Create Sub-Account Dialog**
- ✅ Form: name, slug, admin selection
- ✅ Auto-generate slug from name
- ✅ Select admin from team members
- ✅ Form validation with zod
- ✅ React Hook Form integration

#### **3. Navigation & Routes**
- ✅ Added `/settings/sub-accounts` route
- ✅ Added "Sub-Accounts" to sidebar menu
- ✅ Building2 icon from lucide-react

#### **4. Workspace Selector Enhancement** (NEXT)
- [ ] Show hierarchy: Master → Sub-Accounts
- [ ] Tree view with parent-child relationship
- [ ] Quick switch between workspaces
- [ ] Visual indicator for sub-accounts

#### **5. Dashboard Updates** (FUTURE)
- [ ] Owner dashboard: show all sub-accounts
- [ ] Admin dashboard: show only their sub-account
- [ ] Metrics aggregation for owner across all sub-accounts

---

## 📋 Phase 5: Business Logic (PENDING)

### **Tasks:**

#### **1. Automatic Membership Management**
- [ ] When sub-account created, add admin as owner
- [ ] Automatically add master owner to sub-account (for visibility)
- [ ] Handle admin deletion (transfer or delete sub-account)

#### **2. Data Access Controls**
- [ ] Verify RLS policies work correctly (should already work)
- [ ] Test that admin only sees their sub-account data
- [ ] Test that owner sees all sub-accounts' data

#### **3. Workspace Switching**
- [ ] Allow owner to switch between master and sub-accounts
- [ ] Update current workspace context
- [ ] Refresh data when switching

#### **4. Navigation Guards**
- [ ] Prevent admin from accessing other sub-accounts
- [ ] Show/hide sub-account management based on role
- [ ] Redirect logic for unauthorized access

---

## 📋 Phase 6: Testing (PENDING)

### **Test Scenarios:**

#### **Owner (Master Workspace)**
- [ ] Can create sub-accounts
- [ ] Can delete sub-accounts
- [ ] Can see all sub-accounts in list
- [ ] Can switch to any sub-account
- [ ] Can see all users across all sub-accounts
- [ ] Can customize master workspace appearance
- [ ] Can access any sub-account's data

#### **Admin (Sub-Account Owner)**
- [ ] Can only see their sub-account
- [ ] Can customize their sub-account appearance
- [ ] Can manage members in their sub-account
- [ ] Cannot see other sub-accounts
- [ ] Cannot delete other sub-accounts
- [ ] Can only see contacts/deals in their sub-account
- [ ] Can delete their own sub-account (optional)

#### **Member (Sub-Account)**
- [ ] Can only see their sub-account
- [ ] Cannot customize appearance
- [ ] Can only see assigned contacts/deals
- [ ] Cannot access other sub-accounts

#### **Data Isolation**
- [ ] Contacts in Sub-Account A not visible in Sub-Account B
- [ ] Deals in Sub-Account A not visible in Sub-Account B
- [ ] Meetings in Sub-Account A not visible in Sub-Account B
- [ ] Owner can see all data across all sub-accounts

## 🎯 Architecture Summary

### **Current Implementation:**

```
Master Workspace (parent_workspace_id = NULL)
  ├── Owner: Alice (role = 'owner')
  │   ├── Can see everything
  │   ├── Can create/delete sub-accounts
  │   ├── Can customize master theme
  │   └── Member of ALL sub-accounts
  │
  ├── Sub-Account 1 (parent_workspace_id = master_id)
  │   ├── Owner: Bob (role = 'owner' of this workspace)
  │   │   ├── Can customize Sub-Account 1 theme ✅
  │   │   ├── Can manage Sub-Account 1 members
  │   │   └── Can only see Sub-Account 1 data
  │   ├── Member: Carol
  │   └── Member: Dave
  │
  ├── Sub-Account 2 (parent_workspace_id = master_id)
  │   ├── Owner: Eve (role = 'owner' of this workspace)
  │   │   ├── Can customize Sub-Account 2 theme ✅
  │   │   └── Can only see Sub-Account 2 data
  │   └── Viewer: Frank
  │
  └── Sub-Account 3 (parent_workspace_id = master_id)
      └── Owner: Grace (role = 'owner' of this workspace)
```

### **Key Features:**
- ✅ Owner has visibility across ALL sub-accounts (member of all)
- ✅ Each admin is OWNER of their sub-account workspace
- ✅ Data isolation via separate workspace_id (RLS already works)
- ✅ Theme customization per workspace (already exists)
- ✅ Hierarchy tracked via parent_workspace_id

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### **Why Option 1 (Parent-Child Workspaces)?**

**Advantages:**
1. ✅ Minimal database changes (1 column + functions)
2. ✅ Existing RLS policies work without modification
3. ✅ Theme customization already works per workspace
4. ✅ Data isolation automatic (separate workspace_id)
5. ✅ Permission system already supports it
6. ✅ Faster implementation (weeks vs months)

**Trade-offs:**
- Owner must be member of all sub-accounts (manageable)
- UI must show hierarchy clearly (design challenge)
- Workspace selector more complex (tree structure)

### **Alternative Considered (Sub-Accounts Table):**
- Would require 4-6 weeks implementation
- All data tables need sub_account_id column
- All RLS policies need rewriting
- More explicit but much more work
